Swerve JS

Here's a simulator that lets you experiment with swerve model found at https://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/papers/2426.

Simulator can be accessed at https://swerve-model.herokuapp.com.

Set your bot dimensions, size scale and speed scale, then hit reset.

Use fwd, str, and rcw to set values for model. 

Set iterations to visualize. You can change fwd, str, and rcw while model is running.

You can use WSAD to control fwd and str. Left and right arrows control rcw.
